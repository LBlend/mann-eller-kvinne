## Classifiers  

### Naive Bayes  

The naive bayes classifier is a simple machine learning mmodel which has been used for many years in NLP.
It is classified as simple because it cares about the frequency of words rather than word sequences or any other parameters.

### Recurrent Neural Network  

The model is built with inspiration from [this guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_classification_rnn)
