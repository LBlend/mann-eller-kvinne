## Code guidelines

## Back-end

All Python code must meet these requirements:

- PEP8, but with a maximum of 120 characters.
- All strings must use single quotation marks i.e `'`. The exception to this is if there's a string within another string.
- Files, variable names and function names should be written in snake_case

## Misc

- All files for Docker related stuff must use double quotation marks `"`.
