    <h1>ðŸ¤µ Mann eller Kvinne? ðŸ’ƒ</h1>
    <p>A website that guesses whether you're a man or a woman based on what you type</p>

The website makes a guess by using simple machine learning algorithms.
The model is trained on 3000+ book reviews featured in norwegian media and its goal is to highlight the difference between men and women in the way they write.

The concept of this website is inspired by a controversy in Norway. This controversy stemmed from a criminal offense case where threatning letters had been sent. There was discussion about whether or not the letters were written by a man or a woman due to the letter using the word "tisse" instead of "pisse". You can read more about the case [here](https://www.nrk.no/kultur/uenige-om-bruken-av-ordet-_tisse_-1.15206839)

You're welcome to contribute if you feel like there's something missing or if there's something that can be improved. If you know react or know anything about machine learning we highly appreaciate any contributions.

## A quick note

This website's purpose is to discover the difference between men and women in their writing.
It should be noted though that the models that are used to make predictions are not optimized and are trained on a fairly small dataset.
In other words, you should think critically about the results. This project's is not meant for any serious purpose or reasearch.
